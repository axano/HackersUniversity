Pre-engagement:
  1.Get a permit (optional, but good to have).
  2.Define the scope. (The bigger, the better.)

Reconnaissance:
  1.Perform a whois scan
  2.Find the core developers of the site (humans.txt), find web app technologies by looking at their linkedin, cv.
  3.Find job offers, used technologies are usualy listed.
  
Footprinting:
  1.Find the subdomains that host web applications.
  2.Look for web apps served on ports other than 80,443.
  3.Get to know the application.(Register an account, use it.)
  4.Map used technologies(look at cookies,url's,errors,sessions,Header position, file extensions)
  5.Map the application end points/url's (including AJAX, XML, API).
  6.Map the parameters/entry points of each page(POST,GET,AJAX,XML).
  7.Map http headers.
  8.Look for unexpected HTTP methods
  9.Look for WAF, load balancers, Virtual servers and IP's.
    For load balancers you can:
        analyze Timestamps, Etag header, Last modified header
        look for load balancer specific cookies
        look for ssl anomalies
        analyze http source code
    For proxies you can:
        send a trace request and look for X-forwarded-for headers
        look for modified request paths
        if the proxy is open you can use it to scan the internal network
    For WAF detection:
        look for timeouts when sending palyoads to the web app
        look for exotic cookies
        errors comming after sending exotic http methods(Trace,PUT e.t.c)
  10.Map the directory structure. Dont forget robots.txt, humans.txt 
        try "parent directory" robots.txt in google search together with other dorks if
        robots.txt is not present in root directory.
  11.Review comments in html.
  12.Detect if a CMS is present and the version of it.
      Look at:
          comments in html
          banners
          specific parameters in request and response
   13.Look for Subdomain takeovers.      
  
Application logic:
  1.Test client size controls (logic, flaws, number range,length, format, disabled elements, hidden fields, javascript validation)
  2.Check if the same tests are done server side.
  
Authentication and registration:
  1.Test password quality (requirements during registration)
  2.Test for user enumeration (user activity, forums, messages, scoreboards, login errors, calculate time difference between errors)
  3.Test for password guessing (waf present, ipban, rate limiter, cloudflare)
  4.Test account recovery (try giving unespected parameters when asked for username, userid, email)
    check recovery link randomness,
    weak encryption algorythm,
    reusability of recover link after using it once,
    predict user security questions by looking htem up on socail media
  5.Test remember me function.
    session validity after logout,
  6.Test impersonation function.
  7.Test username uniqueness
    Try registering with utf-8 symbols and watch for normalisation,
    Try invisible characters,
  8.Try autogenerated credentials predictability.
  9.Check for unsafe transmission.
  10.Check for insecure storage.
  11.Check if user validation happens after login.
  12.map parameters related to authorization and authentication and check for:
      predictability
      weak encoding
  13.Is eavesdropping possible?
  14.Check for CSRF
  15.Bypass login with SQLi
  16.Check for XML-backed login forms bypass
  17.Check for errors in 0Auth
  18.Session hijacking through bruteforce and predictabillity.
  19.Map access ACL of common user.
  20.Test for session fixation
  
  
Input handling:
Unless otherwise listed, these methods apply for all request parameters,SOAP endpoints,AJAX endpoints,API's, HTTP headers, Cookie values, Browser environment values.
Dont forget to try multiple encodings
    1.Try directory traversal on parameters that are file related.
    2.Try bit flipping on encrypted parameters.
    3.Bypass client side validation routines
    4.>> SQLi
    5.>> LFI 
    6.>> HTML injection
    7.>> XSS (stored, reflected, self)
    8.>> Embedded Scripts (php,SSI,ASP,JSP,SQL,HTML tags)
    9.>> Boundary checks (Integer overflow, negative numbers,Boolean, Strings, Wildcards, other logic flaws)
    10.>>SSRF
    11.>> XPATH injection (XML)
    12.>> LDAP injecton 
    13.>> Custom parameters injection
    14.>> Log injection
    15.>> Command injection (Server OS Dependable)
    16.>> HTTP response splitting
    17.>> File upload filter bypass
    18.>>XXE
    19.>>Directory Disclosure
    
Application hosting & managing:
    1.Look for known vulnerabilities in detected server version.
    2.Check for default credentials used on manager interface.
    3.Look for remote terminal ports (ssh, telnet, rdp).
    4.Look for application management aplication ports (Tomcat, Java Sun,Jenkins, e.t.c)
    5.>> FTP, SFTP,
